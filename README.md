# Oasis Tools

Various useful tools and scripts for the Oasis ecosystem.

Each tool is in its own directory and contains its own `README.md` with
instructions on how to build and run that particular tool.

For some tools, we also provide binary releases. Check out
<https://github.com/oasisprotocol/tools/releases> for the list.
